##Facade

####What is a Facade?
Similar to an adapter, a facade focuses on modifying the interface. But unlike an adapter which focuses on converting between existing interfaces, a facade focuses on simplifying an existing interface to a new interface. Like its name suggest, a facade gives a system a fake face for which a client can submit requests.
