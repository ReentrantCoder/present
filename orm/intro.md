##Introduction to ORMs

####What is an ORM?

ORM stands for objection-relational database. Objected-oriented programming and 
databases are two very disparate system. But they do share a common goal of trying
to describe entities. Sometimes, there is a need in object-oriented systems to 
store the objects in a database. This is where ORMs come into place to help.
