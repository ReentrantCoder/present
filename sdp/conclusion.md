##Conclusion

####Wrapping Up

In the presentation, we covered structural design patterns. We've seen that both the adapter and facade
patterns modify the clients interface. We've examined the similarities between the compositie,
decorator, and proxy patterns. And we've learned how the flyweight pattern helps save memory.

Thank you for reading. I hope this presentation taught or refreshed your structural design patterns.

####Code and Figures

I got the facade UML diagram from wikipedia and all of other the UML diagrams from Liz Boese's CSCI 5828 lecture slides.

I got the code for adapter and decorator from Head First Design Patterns and the code for composite, proxy and flyweight from Wikipedia.
