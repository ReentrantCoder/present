##Adapter

#### What is an Adapter?
An adapter takes a class or object coded towards one interface and converts it for use against another interface. The adapter pattern performs the exact same functionality as a physical adapter. Consider how a VGA-to-HDMI adapter converts between the two different video inputs. It's like that.
