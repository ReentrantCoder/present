##Setting Up Hibernate

To setup up hibernate, we will first need to download all the necessary JARs. The most
recent version can be found in the link below.

http://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/

Place them in a directory where they can stay permanently on your computer. We 
will configure our Eclipse build path to point to them. So if you move the JARs,
you will have to reconfigure your build path.

Open a new project in Eclipse. Right click that project. Click on "Build path > configure build path".
Click on "Add Library". Then add the external JARs to your library. Once done, you
should have a configuration as seen below.

####Next Steps
Second we'll need to configure up Hibernate so [let's continue with the configuration](https://github.com/trekbaum/present/blob/master/orm/conf.md)
