##Conclusion

####Wrapping Up

Thank you for reading. I hope this presentation taught or refreshed your ORM basics.

####Code and Figures

The Hibernate configuration XML is from the Gontu web series.
The screenshots are all from my own step-by-step setup and running of Hibernate.

I completed a subset of the Hibernate setup code for Dr. Boese's CSCI 5448 quiz 4.
I sought to differentiate that work from the work submitted for this project by
adding a conceptual discussion about ORMs, by adding code beyond the requirements of
the quiz, and by presenting in Markdown.
