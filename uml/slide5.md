##Design Patterns in UML

####Scope of this Slide

For this presentation, I will not explain design patterns. That is the topic of
another student's presentation. I will only provide proof of concept that 
design patterns can be clearly expressed in UML. I will only demonstrate UML
on a couple of design patterns because there are too many to cover in this 
presentation.

I have taken examples from Source Making (https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) to make this slide.
