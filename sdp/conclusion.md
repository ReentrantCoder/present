##Conclusion

####Wrapping Up

In the presentation, we covered structural design patterns.

Thank you for reading. I hope this presentation taught or refreshed your structural design patterns.

####Code and Figures

I got the facade UML diagram from wikipedia and all of other the UML diagrams from Liz Boese's CSCI 5828 lecture slides.

I got the code for adapter and decorator from Head First Design Patterns, the code for composite
and flyweight from Wikipedia, and the code for proxy from Sourcemaking.
