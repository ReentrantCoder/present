##Conclusion

####Wrapping Up

In the presentation, we covered design-oriented UML. Here is the summary: UML is a standarization of several popular factions of modeling languages. Activity diagrams are dynamic models that depict high-level logic flow. Class diagrams are static models that depict low-level structure. Sequence diagrams are dynamic models that depict the exchange of messages between objects. Each of these has its own set of related symbols to represent concepts.

Thank you for reading. I hope this presentation taught or refreshed your UML basics.

####Code and Figures
All code and figures except for those in slide 5 were created by me. They are my original content. 
The diagrams were made in Lucid Chart (www.lucidchart.com).
