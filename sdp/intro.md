##Introduction

####The Gang of Four
The seminal work for all design patterns is _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_ by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and Vlissides. This work has become so influential that the four authors have become known as the Gang of Four.

####Scope of this Presentation
To properly define the scope of this presentation, I will be restricting my
discussion to structural design patterns described by the Gang of Four. I will cover them all except for bridge.
I won't cover bridge because it is the most complex and because there is much more than 45 minutes worth of content between the six remaining patterns. 

#### What is a Structural Design Pattern
Structural design patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways 
to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

####Next Steps
One of the easiest structural design patterns is adapter so [let's begin with the adapter pattern](https://github.com/trekbaum/present/blob/master/sdp/adapter.md)

Or return to the [table of contents.](https://github.com/trekbaum/present/blob/master/sdp/README.md)
