##Introduction

####What is an antipattern?
An antipattern is a common countereffective solution to a software problem. 
Antipatterns increase development time, introduce risk, or obscure code.

It is important to learn antipatterns so that they can be avoided.

####How does is vary from a code smell?
Code smell are snippets of code that hint at a problem. They are not always bad
like antipatterns. The line between antipattern and code smell is very blurred.
For example, about half of my citations claims magics numbers are a smell while
the other half of my citations claims magic numbers are an antipattern. But this
is just a matter of opinion with which I will not bother.

####Scope of this presentation?
There are over 40 known antipatterns. That's far more than I can cover in this talk.
I chose to cover the antipatterns that I thought were interesting. I focused on
antipatterns that lent themselves better to code or UML examples.

####Types of antipatterns
Antipatterns have many different varieties. Different sources categorizes them
differently. Sourcemaking groups them as follows:

######Software development antipatterns

######Software architecture antipatterns

######Management antipatterns

####Next Steps
One of the easiest antipatterns is magic number so [let's begin with the adapter pattern](https://github.com/trekbaum/present/blob/master/anti/slide1.md)
