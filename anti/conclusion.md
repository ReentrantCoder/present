##Conclusion

####Other antipatterns

There are too many other antipatterns to cover. But in fact, we have already covered
some of them in the CSCI 5828 course. Race conditions and circular dependencies are
antipatterns that we covered while discussing concurrency. The nintey-nine rule (which
simply states that we are inherently bad estimators) and analysis paralysis were touched
upon while we discussed software life cycles.

####Wrapping Up

In the presentation, we covered anti-patterns.

Thank you for reading. I hope this presentation taught or refreshed your anti-patterns.

####Code and Figures

I made the code for magic numbers and got the code for spaghetti code from Wikipedia.
I got the UML for blob, poltergeist, and functional fixation from Sourcemaking.
