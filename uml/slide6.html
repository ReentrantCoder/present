<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>

<p>In the presentation, we covered design-oriented UML. Here is the summary: UML is a standarization of several popular factions of modeling languages. Activity diagrams are dynamic models that depict high-level logic flow. Class diagrams are static models that depict low-level structure. Sequence diagrams are dynamic models that depict the exchange of messages between objects. Each of these has its own set of related symbols to represent concepts.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. I hope this presentation taught or refreshed your UML basics.</p>

<h4>Code and Figures</h4>

<p>All code and figures except for those in slide 5 were created by me. They are my original content. 
The diagrams were made in Lucid Chart (www.lucidchart.com).</p>
